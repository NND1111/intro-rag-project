Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.. ( BY-dən; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who served as the 46th president of the United States from 2021 to 2025. Before becoming president, he was the 47th vice president under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017. He was a U.S. senator from Delaware from 1973 to 2009. Biden was a member of the Senate longer than any other president or vice president.[1][2]

He tried to become the Democratic candidate for president in 1988 and 2008, but dropped out of the race. During the 2008 election, then-Senator Barack Obama picked him to be his running mate. He was reëlected with Obama at the 2012 election, and his term ended in January 2017.

After finishing his second term as vice president, Biden began working at the University of Pennsylvania.[3] In April 2019, Biden launched his presidential campaign for the 2020 election.[4] On April 8, 2020, Biden became the likely nominee for the Democratic nomination after Bernie Sanders ended his campaign.[5] On November 7, he defeated then-President Donald Trump and became the president-elect of the United States.[6] He became president on January 20, 2021. He is the oldest person to serve as president and the first from the state of Delaware. He is also the second Catholic to hold the office, after John F. Kennedy.

As president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure as well. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to fix the 2023 debt-ceiling crisis by creating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. He also made America rejoin the Paris Agreement. He pulled out U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban taking control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by putting sanctions on Russia and giving civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden called the actions of Hamas terrorism,[7] announced military support for Israel and sent a small amount of humanitarian help to the Gaza Strip.[8][9][10]

In April 2023, Biden announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election, and was the presumptive nominee. After performing badly in a June 2024 debate with Trump, age and health concerns increased. These concerns and low popularity lead Biden to end his candidacy and endorse Harris to replace him.

Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942 at St. Mary's Keller Memorial Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania. His family were Irish Catholics.[11][12] His father, Joe Sr., was a businessman.[13] When he was young, his family moved to Wilmington, Delaware. He also began to stutter at an early age.[14] In high school, Biden played football and baseball, but he was not a very good student.[13] Biden attended college at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University. He did not have to fight in the Vietnam War because he was going to college and had asthma as a child.[15]

For many years, Biden was a U.S. senator from Delaware. Biden was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 when he was 29 years old. His election was somewhat of a surprise. The other candidate, J. Caleb Boggs, had more experience and more money to spend on his campaign.[16] He is one of the youngest people to become a U.S. Senator, because he was only two months older than the minimum age, 30, required to be one.[17] (While he was 29 during the election, he turned 30 before he became a senator.)

Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times.[18] He became a prominent defender of Israel as a senator, and said that if there was no country like Israel the U.S. would have to make one.[19] Later in his time in the Senate, Biden served as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Foreign Relations committee deals with American issues in other countries. When Biden was chair, the committee dealt with the 1991 Gulf War, the 2003 War in Iraq, and several treaties. The Judiciary Committee dealt with the choice of Clarence Thomas, Robert Bork, and others for the Supreme Court (SCOTUS). Biden thought that Thomas and Bork should not be on the Court.[20] Though U.S. senators work in Washington, DC, Biden took the train home to Delaware every night.[21]

Before becoming vice president, Biden was ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[22][23][24] which he said was because he was young when elected to the Senate.[25] In November 2009, Biden's net worth was $27,012.[26]

Biden ran for president four times, in 1988, 2008, 2020 and 2024. The first time he was viewed as a good choice early on, but quit after it was discovered he gave a speech that was copied from Neil Kinnock, a British politician.[27]

Biden tried again to get the Democratic Party's nomination in the 2008 presidential election.[28] He ran mostly on foreign issues, especially getting U.S. troops out of Iraq. Many thought of him as a good choice for Secretary of State.[29] He stopped his campaign on January 3, 2008 after he did not get many votes in the Iowa caucus.[30] However, he later became Barack Obama's pick for vice president due to what he knew about Iraq and because the working class liked him.[31][32]

When Biden was running for president, he criticized Obama, talking about his lack of experience, but later he supported Obama to become president. His opponent as vice president was Sarah Palin, who had less experience but was seen as more interesting by the media.[33] Before the election, there were debates between the different candidates running for president or vice president. In the debate between Biden and Palin, many people believed that he knew more about running America than Palin did.[34]

He is the first person from Delaware and first Roman Catholic to be vice president.[37] Biden said that his vice-presidency would not be like any other.[38] He said he would do things differently from Dick Cheney, who had been vice president before him.[39]

Biden's main role was as an advisor to Obama on issues of foreign policy and the economy. Obama asked for Biden's input on most major decisions, such as who to put in the Cabinet and how to fight the War in Afghanistan.[38] Obama put Biden in charge of groups to deal with the problems of the working class, and to watch the money in his stimulus bill.[40][41] Biden also traveled to the Middle East several times for Obama and the U.S. while Vice President.[42] In 2011, Biden led talks on the budget and the debt. On November 6, 2012, Biden was re-elected for a second term as vice president along with President Barack Obama.

In August 2015, Biden said that he was thinking of running for president again in the 2016 U.S. election.[43][44] Biden formed a PAC for his possible run.[45] On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and President Obama by his side, Biden said he would not run for president in 2016.[46][47][48]

Biden never had to break a tie vote in the United States Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president not to do this.[49]

During a tour of the U.S. Senate with reporters before leaving office on December 5, 2016, Biden said that a presidential bid was possible in the 2020 presidential election, after leaving office as vice president. While on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on December 7, he stated "never say never" about running for president in 2020, while also saying he did not expect he would run for office again.[50][51] On January 13, 2017, exactly one week before Donald Trump took office, he said he would not run.[52] However, four days later, on January 17, he took the statement back, saying "I'll run if I can walk."[53]

Biden was mentioned by many news outlets as a potential candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination.[54] In March 2019, he said he may run.[55] He formally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019.[56]

In April 2020, Biden became the only candidate in the primary making him the presumptive nominee for the nomination.[57] At first, he lost the first three primary contests to Senator Bernie Sanders. After winning the South Carolina primary, he gained traction and won most of the Super Tuesday races.

Biden promised when elected he would protect Roe v. Wade decision, create a public option for health insurance, decriminalization of recreational cannabis, pass the Equality Act, create free community college, and a $1.7 trillion climate plan supporting the Green New Deal. He supports regulation instead of a complete ban on fracking.

In early 2020, Biden promised he would pick a woman as his running mate. He also promised that his first Supreme Court appointment would be a black woman.[58] In August 2020, he picked California U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate.[59]

Bush to hold both offices as president and vice president and the first president since Richard Nixon to hold them non-consecutively.

In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders, more than most recent presidents did in their first 100 days. Biden signed more executive orders than any other president since Franklin D. Roosevelt had in their first month in office.[68] His first actions were rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, rejoining the World Health Organization, a 100-day mandatory face mask requirements on federal property and acts to stop hunger in the United States.[69][70][71][72] His presidency has been focused around his Build Back Better Plan agenda.[73]

In March 2021, when there was an increase in migrants coming to the United States from Mexico, Biden told migrants: "Don't come over." He said that the U.S. was arranging a plan for migrants to "apply for asylum in place", without leaving their original locations. In the meantime, migrant adults "are being sent back", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[79] Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children and told the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help take care of children separated at the border.[80]

On March 23, 2021, all of his cabinet members were confirmed by the United States Senate.

By early July 2021, most of the American troops in Afghanistan were leaving or had left. On August 15, during an offensive by the Taliban, the Afghan government collapsed.[91] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to help the evacuation of American personnel and Afghan allies.[92] He has been criticized for the way he handled the withdrawal.[93] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be "dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves", since the "Afghan military collapsed [against the Taliban], sometimes without trying to fight".[94]

In August 2021, the Biden administration pushed for an infrastructure bill that can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the United States by 45% by 2030. He would also support lowering taxes for people who invest in renewable energy and electric vehicles and would add a fee on methane emissions.[95] The Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill,[96][97] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[98] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[99]
