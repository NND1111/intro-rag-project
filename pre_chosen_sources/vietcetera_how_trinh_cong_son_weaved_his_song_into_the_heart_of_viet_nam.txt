How Trinh Cong Son Weaved His Melodies Into The Heart Of Vietnam

…“Trời ươm nắng cho mây hồng
Mây qua mau em nghiêng sầu
Còn mưa xuống như hôm nào anh đến thăm…”

(The sky weaves sunbeams to tint those clouds rosy
The clouds quickly pass, leaving you in sorrow
The rain continues like it did the day you came…)

For many, the melody of “Mưa Hồng” (Pink Rain) and much of Trinh Cong Son’s music acts as “medicine for the soul,” transforming everyday moments into profound reflection.

Born on February 28, 1939, in Đak Lak province, Trinh Cong Son emerged as a pivotal figure in Vietnamese music, often called the "Bob Dylan of Vietnam." His songs, rich in poetic imagery, resonate with the struggles and hopes of the Vietnamese people, much like Dylan's work reflects the American experience.

With a remarkable catalog of over 600 songs, including 236 widely acclaimed pieces, Trinh’s music has reached every corner of Vietnamese society. It’s hard to find someone in Vietnam who hasn’t encountered his melodies, which transcend class and background, uniting generations through shared emotions.
A Young Trinh Cong Son

Initially studying philosophy at the Jean Jacques Rousseau School in Saigon, his life took a dramatic turn in 1957 when a judo accident left him with severe chest injuries, confining him to a hospital bed for nearly two years.

During this challenging time, Trinh immersed himself in philosophy and literature while discovering the beauty of folk music. He later reflected, “When I got out of the hospital bed, a new passion for music awakened within me,” revealing how adversity can ignite hidden desires.

Love Affair With Music

In the pre-war era, Trinh Cong Son found his passion for music not as a career but as an authentic expression of his emotions. He reflected, “I didn’t arrive at music as someone choosing a career. I wrote my first songs as a natural response to the emotional urges within me.”

His musical journey began in 1958 with “Ướt Mi” (Tearing Lashes), performed by Thanh Thuy. In the following years, Trinh collaborated closely with singer Khanh Ly, who became a vital partner in his artistic path. Their performances at the Quan Van café in the late 1960s catapulted them into the spotlight.

Trinh’s songwriting was shaped by his limited formal education in Vietnamese literature, allowing him to break free from conventional constraints. This freedom enabled him to create innovative lyrics that resonated deeply with audiences.
A Voice For Peace And Love

Trinh Cong Son’s anti-war music, though often less recognized than his love songs, holds deep significance. Tracks like “Nối Vòng Tay Lớn” (The Great Circle of Vietnam), written in 1967, express a heartfelt yearning for peace and a hopeful vision of reconciliation: “From North to South, holding hands.”

His daring vision of reunification emerged during a time when such ideas were unpopular in Saigon. While his songs echoed the global anti-war sentiment, paralleling Bob Dylan’s “Blowin' in the Wind,” Trinh’s compositions uniquely expressed the struggles faced by both sides in Vietnam’s civil war.

As Van Cao, the composer of Vietnam’s National Anthem, noted, Trinh’s work reflects the heart of a child who has known both joy and sorrow in his homeland. His anti-war music remains a powerful symbol of Vietnam’s enduring hope for peace and unity, resonating through generations.

In Peacetime

In the years following the Vietnam War, Trinh Cong Son's music experienced a resurgence in the 1980s. He joined the Ho Chi Minh City Music Association, where he nurtured young artists and continued to create impactful music.

Trinh led a quiet life, devoted to his craft until his passing in 2001 due to complications from diabetes. His death resonated deeply, with fans worldwide mourning the loss of this beloved figure in Vietnamese music. He was laid to rest in Binh Duong, honored for his significant contributions to the cultural landscape.

…The Next Generation

In Hanoi, the Trinh Ca Club has become a vibrant hub for fans of Trinh Cong Son's music over the past 15 years, where listeners connect with the empathy in his songs. Artists like Dieu Thuy believe everyone can find a piece of themselves in his melodies.

Trinh’s cultural impact extends beyond music, influencing films and documentaries, as well as inspiring young Vietnamese artists. The EP “GenZ & Trinh” features modern talents like My Anh, Obito, and Hoang Dung, who reimagine his classics. This trend allows young musicians to honor Trinh’s legacy while infusing their own creativity.

…Vietnam, Forever

Trinh was never motivated by fame; he once said, “I never had the ambition to become a famous songwriter. If life has given me this gift, I must accept it and be responsible for it.”

In recognition of Trinh's influence, on his 80th birthday, he became the first Vietnamese artist featured on Google Doodle, and his contributions are celebrated through street names, statues, and festivals across Vietnam.

As his sister, Trinh Vinh Trinh, states, “Our brother’s legacy belongs to the people of Vietnam.” Esteemed figures like Trong Bang of the Musician Association affirm that Trinh's influence will be remembered forever.
