For ever I’ll sing my lullaby
Praising the langorous stream of your hair,
Your slender fingers,
On your luxuriant hair.
I sing of your frail fingers,
I’ll sing for thousands more years.

Sleep, my sweet heart
The rain is lulling you
Your closed hands are like flower buds
The sap of my life
The nourishing sap of a whole life
Spring just arrived
I’m overwhelmed by regrets

For ever I’ll sing my lullaby
Praising your passionate fingers
Your lovely hands
I’ll sing for thousands more years
All griefs forgotten
Your silhouette will outlast
Eternally over thousands years

For ever I’ll sing my lullaby
Praising your sweet lips
And your lovely hands
That make my sore heart languish
I sing of your sulky expression
I’ll sing over thousands more years

Sleep, my sweet heart,
The rain is lulling you
Your closed hands are like flower buds
The sap of my life
The nourishing sap of a whole life
Spring just arrived
I’m overwhelmed by regrets.

For ever I’ll sing my lullaby
Praising your rosy cheeks
Your hands transport me to a luxurious country
To a horizon of forgetfulness
Your hair brings back a sky of the past
Over more than thousands years

Only the lyrics of my lullaby will outlast
They will resonate in this corner of sky
Where would pervade an early spring
They will sing for ever
Over thousands more years
Lulling to sleep
Lulling someone !
