Regarded as a giant of Vietnamese pop music, Trịnh Công Sơn (1939-2001) crafted over 600 songs, encompassing both love and anti-war themes during the Vietnam War. His music transcended generations, deeply resonating with the Vietnamese soul and shaping the nation’s cultural identity.

His ability to capture the essence of the Vietnamese experience is matchless. As one intellectual noted, “No one else better reflects what’s in the hearts of the Vietnamese.” As national liberation movements emerged across Vietnam, Trịnh Công Sơn transitioned from love songs to powerful compositions that embodied the spirit of resistance and a longing for peace.

His anti-war songs offer profound insights into the human condition during turmoil, emphasizing the struggles faced by individuals amid chaos. Rooted in love, his lyrics advocate for peace, unity, and compassion, calling for an end to violence and a collective healing.

Ngủ Đi Con (Sleep, My Child)

Released in 1965, "Ngủ Đi Con" is a haunting lullaby that captures a mother’s grief as she sends her son to war. The song beautifully expresses themes of love and loss, resonating with listeners across generations:

“Lulls you, lulled you two times

Oh this body was formerly little and tender…

…why do you sleep at the age of twenty?”

The lyrics, which include the haunting refrain, convey a mother’s sorrow as she mourns the loss of her soldier son. Trịnh Công Sơn’s words reflect not just personal anguish but also a universal sentiment shared by mothers everywhere, transcending cultural and temporal boundaries.

This song gained remarkable popularity, particularly in Japan, where it sold over two million copies in 1969 and earned Trịnh Công Sơn the prestigious Japanese Gold Record Award in 1972. Its translation and adaptation showcased its powerful anti-war message, turning a lament into a lullaby that echoes the hopes of countless families affected by conflict.
Ta Thấy Gì Đêm Nay (What Have I Seen For Tonight)

When "Ta Thấy Gì Đêm Nay" was released in 1968, it captured the urgent need for healing in the aftermath of war. The song reflects on the physical and emotional scars left behind, emphasizing the importance of reconnecting and nurturing relationships. Expresses this through lines that speak of “Hands, countless hands" bridging divides, fostering love, and mending broken hearts:

“The winds of peace return from all directions

The waters of happy times flow freely

The rhythm of life is so vast it rubs out hatred..”

In the introduction to his music collection "Kinh Việt Nam," Trịnh Công Sơn expressed, “The singing can be raised to nurture the dream.” The song poses profound questions about human experience amid chaos, using vivid imagery and metaphor to convey feelings of despair intertwined with hope.

Trịnh Công Sơn believed that music can inspire change, stating, “The songs were born from the joy heard in people’s hearts.”

Huế - Sài Gòn - Hà Nội (Hue - Saigon - Hanoi)

Composed in 1969, "Huế - Sài Gòn - Hà Nội" reflects the profound socio-political turmoil of the Vietnam War, reflecting the complex emotions of a nation divided yet yearning for unity. Trịnh Công Sơn juxtaposes Vietnam's three major cities - Huế, Sài Gòn (Ho Chi Minh City), and Hà Nội - highlighting their distinct characteristics and shared experiences.

Through its lyrics, Trịnh Công Sơn conveys nostalgia, a love for homeland, and envisioning a future that:

“Old resentment and hatred traces will fade

Oh North South Central, uniting as a whole

destroy border, widen roads to build a peaceful land”

His call for unity resonates powerfully:

“Let me go to the top of the mountain to sing happy love songs.”

Trịnh Công Sơn envisions a future where people come together to “build schools, hold markets,” and cultivate a peaceful nation. The fast rhythm and determined melody echo the urgency of the times, while the lyrics, though lengthy, resonate with a sense of hope and resilience.

Written in 1968, "Nối Vòng Tay Lớn" stands as an anthem for unity between North and South Vietnam. Its significance soared when Trịnh Công Sơn performed it as the first song on Saigon Radio after the city’s liberation on April 30, 1975.

That afternoon, as the streets filled with celebrating crowds, listeners were captivated when Trịnh Công Sơn’s voice broke through the airwaves: “I am Trịnh Công Sơn…today is our dream day…” His heartfelt rendition symbolized a new beginning, where former divisions dissolved into a collective joy for a reunited nation.

Originally recorded by singer Khánh Ly in 1969, the song quickly became a rallying cry for students and youth, fostering a sense of community and aspiration for peace and inspiring countless collective activities.

Today, this song remains a cherished piece of Trịnh Công Sơn's legacy, performed by over 60 artists.
